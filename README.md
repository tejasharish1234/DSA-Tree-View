This repo contains my team's Web tech final project which is a course we have in sem 3. In this project, we build a working model that is able to visually demonstrate the following DSA concepts using trees

1. Infix-Prefix-Postfix: Enter an expression in one of the forms and the resultant is a tree which depicts how the calculations are made along with the final answer.
2. Inorder-Preorder-Postorder: Enter a series of numbers in one of the forms and the resultant explains how tree traversal happens in the nodes.
